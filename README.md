# Protective Open-Source License (POSL)

# 1.0 Introduction

Open-source software is a good thing and so popular licenses such as the simple MIT and BSD licenses are.

Making money with open-source software which was written by others – either directly or indirectly – is not wrong, because one of the goals of free and open-source software is that financial aspects shall not make a difference. However, we nowadays see that both sway and money is concentrated within huge tech companies. The Big Five, Alphabet/Google (1.85T), Amazon (1.64T), Apple (2.83T), Meta/Facebook (0.923T) and Microsoft (2.33T) together reached a market capitalization of 9.57 Trillion US-Dollar as per January 2022.

While this is not necessarily true for all open-source projects, it can be appropriate to require big companies to pay proper fees for the use of your software. Without loosing at all the philosophy behind open-source software, you can hereby protect your software against abuse of market power; which comes true if a company not invests in the open-source community, either – but especially – by creating good open-source software itself or by paying the authors for their often hard work. It is normal to expect a bounty by big tech companies for security vulnerabilities, so it should be normal for them to show contribution for good open-source software.

The reason behind a so-called Protective Open-Source License (POSL) is **not** to make money. For this purpose other or even custom licenses may be more suitable. Its goal is to require a fair contribution back to the open-source authors in cases where a **huge imbalance** is evident while not touching the license in all other cases.

# 2.0 Philosophy

The philosophy behind open-source and the license itself shall not be touched.

Therefore, this is not a license, it is an license amendment article; the original text of the license shall not be touched. People or companies which are not considered as big company must be sure that nothing changes for them.

# 3.0 Amendment Article
### Standard POSL 1.0

You can use this amendment article for any license you feel it would fit for.

> Restriction (Standard POSL 1.0): For legal entities with a yearly revenue exceeding 50 million US-Dollar (or an equivalent of) the license text below is valid with the exception, that in modification of the license, for any right granted there (especially the use, modification and distribution) the author has the right of fair compensation which must be individually agreed. This restriction does not apply to non-profit organizations. This text must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the source code.

In case you want to modify any part of this text (e. g. the 50 million dollar limit), please change `Standard POSL 1.0` to `Modified POSL`.

# 4.0 Example License

As an example, this is the full text of the popular MIT license including the Standard POSL 1.0 article. In order to highlight that the original text was extended, the first line was changed from `MIT License` to `MIT License (Protective)`:

> MIT License (Protective)
>
> Copyright (c) \<year\> \<copyright holders\>
>
> Restriction (Standard POSL 1.0): For legal entities with a yearly revenue exceeding 50 million US-Dollar (or an equivalent of) the license text below is valid with the exception, that in modification of the license, for any right granted there (especially the use, modification and distribution) the author has the right of fair compensation which must be individually agreed. This restriction does not apply to non-profit organizations. This text must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the source code.
